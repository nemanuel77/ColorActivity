# ColorActivity
Changing the background color of an application using a spinner selection.

This the the README file for the CIS3515 Lab 3 Assignment.

To give a brief overview of the project, a spinner loads in a resource of stringarrays, which have been set 
to the string values of simple colors. Using a custom adapter, a textview is created using each of these strings, and is 
assigned a backgroundcolor value of its name. Clicking a button on the page will assign the background color of the layout 
to the color of the selected view.
